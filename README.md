# Snapify
## A simple tweak to remove the send button in messages, replaced by keyboard key

**What is Snapify?**

Snapify is an opensource tweak to make the messages app behave like Snapchat's sending system

**Why am I opensourcing this?**

I'm opensourcing this tweak to allow others to learn from what I have done, as without others opensourcing their work, I would not have been able to release this or my other tweaks!

**What is involved?**

This project utilized:
* Theos
* Logos
* Objective-C
* Lots and lots of time.....

**What things do I need as a developer?**

This project utilizes:
* [RemoteLog](https://github.com/Muirey03/RemoteLog)
    * A library to replace NSLog to simplify debugging. Not used in the final release version, but important for developing the tweak. Some users may notice a lag depending on your internet connection.
* [Cephei](https://github.com/hbang/libcephei)
    * A library to simplify the communication with preferences. Modern and easy to learn, it also contains resources such as a Twitter cell.
* [Lacertosus' Preference Cells](https://github.com/LacertosusRepo/Preference-Cell-Examples)
    * The greatest collection of fancified and finished preference cells to make your users experience as clean as possible. I have added modifications to the originals(support for Light/Dark mode, and a few other changes), but all credit goes to the original creator!
